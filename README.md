# Water Potability Analysis App ðŸ’§

A comprehensive machine learning application for analyzing water quality parameters and predicting water potability using advanced data science techniques.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This Streamlit-based application provides an end-to-end solution for water quality analysis, from data exploration to machine learning model deployment. The app helps users understand water quality patterns, preprocess data effectively, and make accurate potability predictions using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset Content

* The dataset for this project is sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nimapourmoradi/water-potability)**.
* The dataset for this project uses water quality data with 3,276 samples, covering 9 physicochemical properties (e.g., pH, chloramines, turbidity) and a binary potability label. It includes measurements like hardness (mg/L) and total dissolved solids (ppm), with some missing values handled during preprocessing. The data helps predict drinkability and identify contamination risks, though it excludes microbial testing. Ideal for public health research and water safety monitoring.
