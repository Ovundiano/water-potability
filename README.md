# Water Potability Analysis App ðŸ’§

A comprehensive machine learning application for analyzing water quality parameters and predicting water potability using advanced data science techniques.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This Streamlit-based application provides an end-to-end solution for water quality analysis, from data exploration to machine learning model deployment. The app helps users understand water quality patterns, preprocess data effectively, and make accurate potability predictions using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset Content

* The dataset for this project is sourced from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nimapourmoradi/water-potability)**.

* The dataset for this project uses water quality data with 3,276 samples, covering 9 physicochemical properties (e.g., pH, chloramines, turbidity) and a binary potability label. It includes measurements like hardness (mg/L) and total dissolved solids (ppm), with some missing values handled during preprocessing. The data helps predict drinkability and identify contamination risks, though it excludes microbial testing. Ideal for public health research and water safety monitoring.

### Key Metrics Included

|Category|Metrics|Unit|Relevance to Potability|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Basic Properties|pH, Hardness, Turbidity|pH scale, mg/L, NTU|Directly impacts safety and taste.|
|Chemical Content|Chloramines, Sulfate, TDS|ppm, mg/L|High levels indicate contamination.|
|Organic Matter|Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes|ppm, ppb|Linked to disinfection byproducts.|
|Electrical Traits|Conductivity|Î¼S/cm|Correlates with dissolved ions.|
|Target Variable|Potability (0=Unsafe, 1=Safe)|Binary|WHO drinking water standards.|

### Data Characteristics

* Temporal Coverage: Single snapshot (timestamps optional if your data includes them).

* Missing Values:
    * ph (15% missing), Sulfate (24% missing), Trihalomethanes (5% missing).
    * Handled via imputation or deletion in preprocessing.py.

* Class Distribution:
    * Potable (Safe): 61% of samples.
    * Non-Potable: 39% of samples.


## Business Requirements

* *For clarity, this is an education-based project, and the organization described is for illustrative purposes.*

* **AquaSafe Analytics**, a water quality consultancy, faces challenges in helping governments and NGOs monitor drinking water safety efficiently. Currently, analysts manually assess water quality reports from disparate sources, spending hours compiling data to identify contamination risks and compliance with safety standards. This slow, error-prone process delays critical interventions, especially in regions with aging infrastructure or environmental stressors. With varying water quality challenges across urban and rural areas, a scalable solution is needed to standardize assessments and predict potability in real time.

* **AquaSafe Analytics** has requested a user-friendly, cost-effective tool to automate water quality analysis. During planning, the data science team proposed a Streamlit-based application leveraging interactive visualizations, statistical analysis, and machine learning. This solution would enable:
   * Rapid identification of unsafe water sources using key metrics (pH, turbidity, chemical levels).

   * Predictive modeling to flag high-risk areas before contamination spreads.

   * Data-driven recommendations for infrastructure upgrades or treatment interventions.

* The toolâ€™s success could extend to global datasets or integrate with IoT sensors for live monitoring.


## Hypothesis and how to validate


## Machine Learning Business Case

* We aim to develop a binary classification model to predict water potability (safe/unsafe) using physicochemical properties from water quality datasets. This solution will enable governments and NGOs to proactively identify contamination risks and allocate resources efficiently.

* Ideal Outcomes
    * Model Performance:
        * Accuracy â‰¥ 90% and F1-score â‰¥ 0.88 on the test set.
        * Outperform traditional rule-based methods (e.g., WHO threshold checks) by at least 20% in precision.
    * Business Impact:
        * Reduce manual testing costs by 30% through prioritized sampling.
        * Cut decision-making time from days to minutes for contamination responses.

* Model Capabilities
* 1 - Input: Water quality metrics (pH, turbidity, chloramines, etc.).
* 2 - Output:
    * Binary prediction (0 = Unsafe, 1 = Safe).
    * Probability score and risk factors (e.g., "High trihalomethanes detected").
* 3 - User Interaction:
    * Streamlit app allows input of custom water samples for instant predictions.
    * Visualizations of feature importance (e.g., "pH contributes 25% to potability").

* The model is trained on the Kaggle Water Potability Dataset, containing 3,276 samples with 9 physicochemical features. Global coverage (urban/rural, diverse water sources) and Missing data: Handled via imputation during preprocessing.
