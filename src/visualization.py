        **Summary of Findings:**
        - The dataset reveals complex relationships between water quality parameters and potability.
        - Engineered features (e.g., pH-Hardness interaction) improve model performance.
        - Random Forest and XGBoost models consistently perform well, with AUC scores above 0.7.
        - Key features influencing potability include pH, Hardness, and Solids.

        **Recommendations:**
        - **Monitoring**: Prioritize regular testing of high-impact features identified by the model.
        - **Validation**: Use this tool for preliminary screening, followed by laboratory confirmation.
        - **Data Collection**: Gather more balanced data to enhance model accuracy.
        - **Feature Expansion**: Consider adding new water quality parameters (e.g., microbial content) for better predictions.

        **Next Steps:**
        - Deploy this app in water treatment facilities for real-time analysis.
        - Integrate with IoT devices for automated data collection.
        - Explore ensemble methods to further improve prediction accuracy.
